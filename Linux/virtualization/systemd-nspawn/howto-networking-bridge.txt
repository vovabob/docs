------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have configured a network bridge on the host system, you can create a virtual Ethernet link 
for the container and add its host side to the network bridge. 

This is done with the --network-bridge=bridge-name option. 
Note that --network-bridge implies --network-veth, i.e. the virtual Ethernet link is created automatically. 
However, the host side of the link will use the vb- prefix instead of ve-, 
so the systemd-networkd options for starting the DHCP server and IP masquerading will not be applied.

The bridge management is left to the administrator. For example, 
the bridge can connect virtual interfaces with a physical interface, 
or it can connect only virtual interfaces of several containers. 

See systemd-networkd#Network bridge with DHCP and 
systemd-networkd#Network bridge with static IP addresses for example configurations using systemd-networkd.

There is also a --network-zone=zone-name option which is similar to --network-bridge 
but the network bridge is managed automatically by systemd-nspawn and systemd-networkd. 
The bridge interface named vz-zone-name is automatically created when the first container 
configured with --network-zone=zone-name is started, and is automatically removed when the last container 
configured with --network-zone=zone-name exits. Hence, this option makes it easy to place multiple related 
containers on a common virtual network. 

Note that vz-* interfaces are managed by systemd-networkd same way as ve-* interfaces 
using the options from the /usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-vz.network file.
