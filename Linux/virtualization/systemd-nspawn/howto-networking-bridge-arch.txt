-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To get configure a static IP address on the container, we need to override the system 
/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network file, which provides a DHCP configuration 
for the host0 network interface of the container. 

This can be done by placing the configuration into /etc/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network :

/etc/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network
[Match]
Name=host0

[Network]
DNS=192.168.1.254
Address=192.168.1.94/24
Gateway=192.168.1.254

Make sure that systemd-networkd.service is enabled in the container.
