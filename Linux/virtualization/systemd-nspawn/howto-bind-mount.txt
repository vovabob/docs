--bind=, --bind-ro=

Bind mount a file or directory from the host into the container. 
Takes one of: a path argument — in which case the specified path will be mounted from the host to the same path in the container, 
or a colon-separated pair of paths — in which case the first specified path is the source in the host, 
and the second path is the destination in the container, or a colon-separated triple of source path, destination path and mount options. 
The source path may optionally be prefixed with a "+" character. If so, the source path is taken relative to the image's root directory. 
This permits setting up bind mounts within the container image. 

The source path may be specified as empty string, in which case a temporary directory below the host's /var/tmp/ directory is used.
