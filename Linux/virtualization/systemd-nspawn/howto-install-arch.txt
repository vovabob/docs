---------------------------------------------------
Create and boot a minimal Arch Linux container
---------------------------------------------------

1). First install arch-install-scripts.

2). Create a directory to hold the container: ~/MyContainer.

3). Use pacstrap to install a basic Arch system into the container: at minimum we need the 'base' package group.

# pacstrap -c ~/MyContainer base [additional packages/groups]

NOTE: The base package does not depend on the linux kernel package and is container-ready.

4). Once installation finished, chroot into the container, and set a root password:

# systemd-nspawn -D ~/MyContainer
# passwd
# logout

NOTES: a) We just chrooting into container, without booting it.
	b) if 'exit' is used instead of 'logout', there is an error message: ...

5). Finally, boot into the container:

# systemd-nspawn -b -D ~/MyContainer

The -b option will boot the container (i.e. run systemd as PID=1), instead of just running a shell, 
and -D specifies the directory that becomes the container's root directory.

6). After the container starts, log in as "root" with your password.
