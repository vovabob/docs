Starting from around 2018, our combined sewage/wastewater system started to become blocked occasionally. At
this stage we did not realize that it is actually our common facility (that is, for all three units A, B, C at 15 Euston
Rd) and we fixed these issues at our own expense. In May 2019 the situation worsened and our unit was subject
to severe sewage/wastewater overflow. Because of our downhill location, our unit was affected the most. I had to
quickly find the solution. Due to previous experience, I already had few local contacts so I called Warren Glynn
from Land & Marine Ltd for help. After an examination, he told me that the pipe that needs to be unblocked is a
common property (See the site plan attached) and advised me to talk to the neighbours. When I talked to them,
including the Respondent, they assured me that they will pay their shares when the job is done. However, when
the work was completed, the Respondent refused to pay giving, as an excuse, the increase of costs and the lack
of formal "consultation". Moreover, not only she didn't pay her share, as a body corporate secretary, she
provoked, by her emails, the owners of Unit C not to pay theirs either (See a copy of the email).
