Step 5.

Starting from around 2018, our combined sewage/wastewater system started to become blocked occasionally. 
At this stage we did not realize that it was a common property for all three units, A, B, C at 15 Euston Rd, 
and we fixed these issues at our own expense. In May 2019 the situation worsened and our unit was subject
to severe sewage/wastewater overflow. Because of our downhill location, our unit was affected the most. 
Due to the previous experience, I already had a few local contacts and I called Warren Glynn
from Land & Marine Ltd for help. After an examination, he told me that the pipe needed to be unblocked was 
common property (see the file 1-drain-plan-Warren.pdf) and advised me to talk to the neighbours. 
When I talked to them, including the Respondent, they assured me that they would pay their share later, 
when the job was done. However, when the work was completed, the Respondent refused to pay giving, 
as an excuse, the increase of costs and the lack of consultation. Moreover, not only did she not pay her share, 
as a "body corporate secretary" she advised the owners of Unit C not to pay theirs either 
(See copies of her email attached).
