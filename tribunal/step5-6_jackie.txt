Step 5.
At this stage we did not realise that it was (rather than “is”; take out “actually”) 
a common property for all three units, A,B,C at 15 Euston Rd. Better colloquial English 
using past tense. “Actually” is unnecessary.

Due to (add “the”) previous experience, I already had (add “a”) few local contacts….. 
“The” points to your earlier action in getting the problem fixed. Just better colloquial English. 
Putting “a” in changes this to its opposite. If you say “I had a few contacts” it means you had several. 
If you say “I had few contacts” it means you had hardly any!!
….he told me that the pipe that needed (rather than “needs”) to be unblocked was 
(rather than “is”; remove “a”) common property…..Past tense better.
When I talked to them……they assured me that they would (remove “will”) pay their share 
(remove “s”) later, when the job was (remove “is”) done. Past tense better.

….giving as an excuse (query “the increase of costs” unless that’s part of her initial complaint; 
instead just put “the cost”) and the lack of “formal consultation” (or just formal consultation). 
Put both words in quotes, or remove them altogether: it will be up to the referee to judge 
whatever that term meant for her.
Moreover, not only did she not pay her share, as “body corporate secretary” she advised 
(or recommended, rather than “provoked”, then remove “by her emails” - if you’re going to attach them, 
no need, also see further down. I have a problem, possibly not important because you cover this elsewhere, 
about exactly when and how she established to you that she was BCS)

Step 6.
As far as I understood, the Respondent gave (remove “was giving”) three reasons……Better tense

1. When I first talked to her (rather than “talked to her first”) she (add “said she” - or if she 
didn’t in fact say, but indicated by other means) accepted (remove “the fact”) that the pipe was 
(not “is”) common property, and (remove “she”) agreed to pay……
After the invoice (remove “became ready”) was presented for payment, she said she (remove “is”) was shocked….

2. She (remove “also blamed”)Better English: accused me of a lack of (as you have used “formal” earlier, 
either use that again, or change the former mention). I’ve slightly reworked how you’ve put this.
Then we come into some rather murkier parts: Why are you including your realisation that 
it is common property again? Would it not be better to clarify that earlier, even before you began 
to have problems or when you got the first problems fixed, you had no idea what her contact details were, 
and then go on to say that she had never given you her contact details, with the result that when 
the invoice (were there more than one?) arrived, you had to go to her unit, and ask her partner for contact details? 

3. ….in her claim (…) she even started to deny the fact (did she or didn’t she? 
It sounds strange to say “she started to deny” Did she deny that it was, in fact, 
common property that was repaired, or something belonging to you alone? Is this why you were surprised?

Because as Body Corporate Secretary she should have known all three units have a common drain system. 
When the problem first arose, before it was pointed out to you by the contractor you hired, 
she failed to tell you that. (This is maybe beside the point. The fact is that the repair was 
to common property. If it’s established that she was BCS, then of course she should have known…..
but her not knowing seems to muddy the waters a bit, and shouldn’t be your problem, imo).
For (remove “the”) reference, I attach ( remove “have attached”)…….for our site, 
(add “plus”) a (very clear) probably not necessary, as the referee will be judging 
the veracity of this job description prepared by  (remove “people from”) Land & Marine Ltd.
