Step 6. Why is the respondent still disputing the claim?

As far as I understood, the Respondent gave three reasons not to pay. 

1) When I first talked to her, she accepted that the blocked pipe was common property 
and agreed to pay her part later. After the invoice was presented for payment, 
she said that she was shocked by the high cost but she never explained which 
particular item of the invoice she disagreed with (See copies of her email attached).

2) She accused me of a lack of consultation. But, as I said earlier, at the beginning 
I simply did not realise that we are dealing with a common property. 
Secondly, she never gave me her phone number or email address, so that, 
when the invoice arrived, I had to go to her unit and ask her partner 
for their contact details.

3) To my surprise, in her claim (CIV-2021-094-000375) she even denies the fact that 
the repaired pipe was common property. As a Body Corporate Secretary she should have known 
that all three units have a common drain system but she failed to tell me that.
For reference, I attach a copy of the Council's drain plan for our site plus 
a job description prepared by Land & Marine Ltd.
