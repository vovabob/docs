As far as I understood, the Respondent was giving three reasons not to pay. Interestingly, these reasons were
changing over time! 1) When I talked to her first, she accepted the fact that the blocked pipe is the common
property and she agreed to pay her part later. After the invoice became ready, she said that she is "shocked by
the high cost" but she never explained which particular item of the invoice she disagreed with. 2) She also
blamed me for the lack of "proper consultation". To a certain degree I can agree with this one. The main reason
for that was the fact that, at the beginning, I did not realise that we are dealing with a common property, so I had
only a verbal agreement with the contractors without any paperwork to share. 3) To my surprise, in her claim
(CIV-2021-094-000375) she even started to deny the fact that it was the common property that was repaired. For
the actual situation, please refer to provided copies of the site plan and the contractors' job description.
