Starting from around 2018 our combined sewage/wastewater system started to become blocked occasionally. At this stage I did not realize that it actually is our common facility (that is, for all three units A, B, C at 15 Euston Rd) and I fixed these issues at our own expenses. In May 2019 the situation worsened and our unit was subject to severe sewage/wastewater overflow. Because our unit was primarily affected, I had to quickly find the solution. As I already had few local contacts, I called Warren Glynn from Land & Marine Ltd for help. After an examination, he told me that the pipe that needs to be unblocked is a common property (See the site plan attached) and advised me to talk to the neighbours. When I talked to them, including the Respondent, they assured me that they will pay their shares when the job is done. However, when the work was completed, the Respondent refused to pay giving, as an excuse, the increased cost and the lack of formal "consultation". Moreover, not only she didn't pay her share, as a body corporate secretary, she provoked, by her emails, the owners of Unit C not to pay their part either (See a copy of the email).
